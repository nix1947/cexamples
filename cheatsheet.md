* size of data is depend on the bits of hardware.

```
int hogs = 21; // This is data declaration and assignment
int dogs, cats = 94 // this will only initilize the cats only
```

## What are literals in programming
* The values are the literals
* 1, 2, 3 are integer literals
* "hello" "world" are the string literals.
* 22, -44 are integer constants.

## Format specifier
```
%d, %s, %c are called the format specifier
```
* different compilers will manage memory location differently.
